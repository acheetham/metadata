The version of Infusion included in this folder was created using a custom build from commit

    ff275c0a685a23a155b9f3aae51b31f546404d7b

of the Infusion master branch

    https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion

using the command line

grunt custom --source=true --include="tooltip, renderer, preferences, tabs"

The following directories were stripped out of the build since they contain code that is included in the infusion-custom.js file:

    src/lib/infusion/components/
    src/lib/infusion/framework/
    src/lib/infusion/components/
    src/lib/infusion/lib/fastXmlPull/
    src/lib/infusion/lib/fonts/
    src/lib/infusion/lib/jquery/core/
    src/lib/infusion/lib/jquery/jQuery-LICENSE.txt
